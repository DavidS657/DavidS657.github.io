                experiences at Georgia Tech, I have cultivated a unique blend of technical and creative skills to create a wide gamut of different projects. Outside of games, I am also an avid fan of music, and have used my passion
                for the medium and the genres within it as a springboard for some auditory-focused projects as well. I hope to take further advantage of the opportunities
                provided to me at Tech to further strive torwards my ultimate goal of becoming a game designer.</div>
